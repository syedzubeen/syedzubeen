- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term 'bug' in computer science originated from an actual insect? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth inside a computer relay and referred to it as the 'first actual case' of a computer bug. Ever since, 'debugging' has been a common term for fixing software issues.
